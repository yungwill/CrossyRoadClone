CSUF CPSC 386 Final Project: Remake Crossy Road using Unreal Engine

As a final project the professor required the class to remake Crossy Road individually when we had at most 
2 weeks of experience in using Unreal engine in the class.
Did not get far in the project.
Was able to get a dynamically generated infinite runner working with cars, trucks, and trains.

Bugs/Problems/Not Implemented:
  -Did not have any animations
  -Camera was connected to player character rather than automatically slowing moving forward
  -Interactions with objects was buggy
  -Water doesn't kill player
  -Could not save data after closing game
  -No coins to collect
  -Movement was not exact like in the actual game
